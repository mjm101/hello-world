# hello-world
Years ago, I learned exactly as much HTML and CSS as I needed to tweak Wordpress templates. It turns out that's not a lot of programming knowledge. I'm here to fix that.

I like puppies, kittens, pretentious craft beers, and long walks on the beach.

(That's a lie. It's really fucking hard to walk on sand. I'd rather just drink beer.) (No one's going to read this, right?)
